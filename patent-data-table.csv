10434311,2019-10-08,Method and apparatus for multimodal electrical modulation of pain,"Apparatus and methods for managing pain uses separate varying electromagnetic fields, with a variety of temporal and amplitude characteristics, which are applied to a particular neural structure to modulate glial and neuronal interactions as a mechanism for relieving chronic pain. In another embodiment, a single composite modulation/stimulation signal which has rhythmically varying characteristics is used to achieve the same results as separate varying electromagnetic fields. Also, disclosed is an apparatus and method for modulating the expression of genes involved in diverse pathways including inflammatory/immune system mediators, ion channels and neurotransmitters, in both the Spinal Cord (SC) and Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) where such expression modulation is caused by spinal cord stimulation or peripheral nerve stimulation using the disclosed apparatus and techniques. In one embodiment of multimodal modulation therapy, the prime signal may be monophasic, or biphasic, in which the polarity of the first phase of the biphasic prime signal may be either cathodic or anodic while the tonic signal may be either monophasic, or biphasic, with the polarity of the first phase of the biphasic tonic signal being either cathodic or anodic.","Stimgenics, LLC",342973
10434941,2019-10-08,Systems and methods for notification of exceeding speed limits,"A wearable device is provided that includes a receiver, a processor, and a transducer.
